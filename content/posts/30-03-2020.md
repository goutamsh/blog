When I first came across term Observability I was bit confused how different it is from Monitoring.
We used to monitor our application and servers using Splunk and some in-house developed softwares.
Let's see how Observability and Monitoring are different.

**Monitoring**:
Monitoring is a verb; something we perform against our applications and systems to determine their state. From basic fitness tests and whether they’re up or down, to more proactive performance health checks. We monitor applications to detect problems and anomalies. As troubleshooters, we use it to find the root cause of problems and gain insights into capacity requirements and performance trends over time.

**Observability**:
It’s a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. So in contrast to monitoring which is something we actually do, observability (as a noun), is more a property of a system. Therefore, if our good old IT systems and applications don’t adequately externalize their state, then even the best monitoring can fall short. 

Observability is instrumenting systems and applications to collect metrics and logs. It’s building apps with the idea that someone is going to
watch them. It comes from system control theory, the foundation of feedback systems, where observability is a measure of how well the internal states of a system
can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs — a kind of digital exhaust. Think of it as a property of a system — another attribute, like functionality,
performance or testability. 

"You can monitor a
system using various
instrumentation. But if the
system doesn’t externalize
its state well enough that
you can figure out what’s
actually going on in there,
then you’re stuck."
