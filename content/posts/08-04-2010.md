ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products - Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana.
They are all developed, managed ,and maintained by the company Elastic.
	
**E** stands for ElasticSearch: used for storing logs

**L** stands for LogStash : used for both shipping as well as processing and storing logs

**K** stands for Kibana: is a visutalization tool (a web interface) which is hosted through Nginx or Apache


Fundamentally if you know how splunk works, it is somewhat functionally similar.

ELK Stack is designed to allow users to take to data from any source, in any format, and to search, analyze, and visualize that data in real time.
